# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means

## Overview
This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on mall shopping data. The goal is to identify distinct groups of mall customers to tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and preparing data for clustering.
- **K-Means Algorithm**: Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- **Optimal Cluster Identification**: Using the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing clusters using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information such as customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score. It is sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository (or any other relevant source).
